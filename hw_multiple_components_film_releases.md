# Homework: React Film Releases

When creating React applications, we want to break up our UI into components, so each component is responsible for one part of the page. Your task for this homework is to start to think about how you might approach this task in your own applications by reading an article published by Facebook (creators of React) and examining an existing codebase.

## Reading

Thinking In React (20 mins) https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html

## Film Releases Application

Run the Film Releases Application:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
Your task is to get familiar with the application.

## Part 1
Draw a diagram that details:
  - the component hierarchy (which component renders which)
  - any props that are passed from parent to child components
  - any state inside any of the components

## Part 2
Answer the following questions:
  1. Where do we directly access an element from the DOM in our React application?
  2. From looking at the code, what do you think might be the difference between the components in the `containers` and `components` directories?
  3. What is the responsibility of the `ReleasesBox` component?
  3. What is the responsibility of the `MovieList` component?
  4. What is the responsibility of the `MovieItem` component?
